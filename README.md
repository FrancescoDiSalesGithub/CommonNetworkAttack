# CommonNetworkAttack
List of Network Captures of all the possible network attacks.

 # Introduction
 
 In this repository we study the network captures of basic network pentesting operations, such as enumeration, reverse shells etc.
 
For this study we have two ip:
* 192.168.56.102 -> client
* 192.168.56.104 -> server

With these ip address we can study the following:

* basic nmap scan (normalnmap.pcap)
* syn stealth scan (synstealth.pcap)
* xmas scan (christmas.pcap)
* null tcp scan (null.pcap)
